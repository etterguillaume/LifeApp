# Life
This open source iOS app estimates how long you have left to live given a couple of simple factors (birthdate, smoking/obesity status).
Could be useful if you have big plans for the future,
Very simple, but I plan to add variables and test some Bayesian estimators in the future.
This app is for educational purposes only (learn Swift and SwiftUI).
Released under MIT Licensing so do whatever you want with it, I really don't care.
